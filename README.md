# CharCreation

Our motivation for this project was to give a user the ability to quickly create and store a d and d character for the fifth edition of the game and be able to come back to the site and retrieve the character at will.

We also added some ai generated art from open ai to help players better visualize their characters 

AS a user, 
I WANT to create my custom (or randomly generated) character to use
SO THAT I can come back to the site and retrieve the character at will
